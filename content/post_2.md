Slug: Calving Ronne Ice Shelf
Authors: Rodrigo Gomez-Fell
Summary: The Ronne Ice Shelf just calved a big piece of ice.

Well another piece of ice has gone to wonder the oceans (more likely the Weddell sea and maybe a bit of the Southern Atlantic). The new iceberg has been named as *A-76* by the entity that gives this dull (but useful) tag names, the **U.S. National Ice Center** (not Centre, is U.S. not U.K.). You can see it in all its glory in this twitter:

I made a little GIF that tells the story prior to its break-up (just the last *~6 months*)

This event is part of the natural life cycle of the ice shelf and ice sheet. Why do I say that? Well if you compare the last time it calved (2000) you will notice that it brake in the same place (check my twitt below where I compare a MODIS optical image with a Sentinel-1 SAR image). Because the breakup is in the same place we can tell that is a cyclic event. It would be interest to observe if the width of the iceberg calved in 2000 is similar to the once calved this week. Compare the two could give and idea of the rate of grow and calving.
