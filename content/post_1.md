Summary: Explaining why I created this unimpressive Blog.

This is the *first* post  of many (hopefully) unremarkable blog posts. Why did I decided to venture in such a journey? Just because I need to hone my writing, coding, git, web and other skills. So hopefully this will be the way. (remember.. **this is the way**)

This is an unimpressive blog, not a boring one (I hope). Because of that I hope to create small projects and upload them, they might be images, graphs or who-knows-what. For know I leave you with a little ShinyApp I did long time ago (follow the link):

 [Mauna Loa CO2 projected emissions](https://rgfell.shinyapps.io/MaunaLoa/?_ga=2.34353953.1639288624.1617956162-872429721.1617956162)
